# EXIF Reader - Streamlit Python


This is a Python project that allows you to extract and view EXIF metadata from images using Streamlit. The EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) metadata contains valuable information about the camera settings, location, and other details related to the image.

## Installation

To use the EXIF Reader, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
 git clone https://github.com/Omerkdr/EXIF-Reader-StreamlitPython.git

2. Change into the project directory:
  cd EXIF-Reader-StreamlitPython


3. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To run the EXIF Reader, execute the following command in your terminal:
streamlit run exif_reader.py


This will launch the application in your default web browser. You can then upload an image file, and the application will display the EXIF metadata associated with that image.
